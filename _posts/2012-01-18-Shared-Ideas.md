Ok, so here is a meta-idea. I need to create a project, where I could post some ideas that I don't have time (or skills) to implement.

There would be, of course, few ideas that I would implement for myself (like this), but the majority of the ideas would be somewhat open sourced.

This project must have few important features:

- Multilanguage support. Since I have some people reading me in russian, I need to write in it. But I want to write in english too, so I don't want to limit myself to one language.

    The question is: do I need inline translates, different pages (with urls like /en/… or /ru/…), or something else.

- Some categorization. there are a lot of idea types I have: from startups to minor features for some open source projects.

- Tags for skills. Since I'm not a superman, there are a lot of areas where I'm not that confident in myself. I would like to outsource those ideas to people who know things, so I'd like to throw the right ideas to the right people.

- Blah blah blah.
